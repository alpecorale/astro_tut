    <p>My name is Aidan and I created this website to show off my work and hobbies. 
    My goal is to work on projects that are interesting to me while sharing and documenting some of the procedure behind the work.
    Right now projects will focus on software and web development, but may expand to creating art, journalism, video production or building stuff in the future.</p>

    <p>This site will update as I learn more, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>
