Welcome to my _new blog_ about creating stuff. Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## Background

I have some previous web development experience, but in an effort to test out some new frameworks and share my projects I am developing this site.  

## Plans

1. **Basic Functionality**: Since it's been a while and I didn't want to build everything from scratch, it was a perfect time to try out Astro for webdevelopment. I was initially planning on trying to use React Library, but realized I did not need React's component based renedering for a project like this. Better yet after playing around with Astro I learned how easy it was to implement React into the site where needed so I can still experiment with it in the future.

2. **Designing**: I intend to improve the design and feel of the website to reflect a professional and aestheticly appealing layout. This is a work in progress as design & CSS are not my forte, but we are learning.

3. **Populatiting the Site**: Lastly the site needs to be populated with content. I have plans to make sections featuring other projects I am working on or have worked on in the past. Possibly a one day builds kind of thing. I also would like to work on some more artistic projects including writing, collage boards or other digital media. At this time I am unsure if blogs will continue, but I will likely try to write something once a week to keep me on track.
